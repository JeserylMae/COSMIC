1. Create two windows using tkinter,
        * one for the loading page and
        * another for the main app.

2. The home Page has two options:
        * play a video
        * use camera

** FOR PLAY VIDEO OPTION **
1. Using tkinter filedialog, access the windows file explorer.
2. The user will select the video.
3. The video will be played by passing the video path in opencv VideoCapture() command.
4. Then using YOLO opencv, the program will count the people in the video frame.
5. If the count surpasses 10, the first 60 seconds of the audio of the video will be recorded. (using sounddevice)
6. Then using librosa, we will calculate the volume of the sound.
7. If the volume exceeds a certain limit, a warning sound will be played.

** USING CAMERA **
1. Once the user selects Use Camera Button, there will be a drop down menu that will appear.
2. In the background, the program will determine the number of cameras the device have.
3. The choices of the menu will be the camera numbers.
4. once the user has selected which camera to use, the program will proceed to Video Capturing.
5. Pass the chosen camera number to opencv VideoCapture() command.
6. Then using YOLO opencv, the program will count the people in the video frame.
7. If the count surpasses 10, the first 60 seconds of the audio of the video will be recorded. (using sounddevice)
8. Then using librosa, we will calculate the volume of the sound.
9. If the volume exceeds a certain limit, a warning sound will be played.




# Note: Use PyCharm for easier installation of dependencies/modules.
# Lahat ng modules na kailangan natin ay nasa requirements.txt, just click install once na
# i-open nyo yong requirements.txt (if PyCharm IDE nyo).
# Use Python 3.10


# Initial plan pa lang yong nasa 'GUI_plan.py' on how we will code the gui
# Bale ito yong mga functions and classes na gagawin natin.
# Each classes are written in separate python file.

# Yong 'SoundVolume.py' ay yong gagawin natin sa pagrerecord ng sound at
# calculation ng volume, once maka-detect ng >= 10 na people si opencv.
